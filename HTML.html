		<h1>HTML Basics</h1>

		<!-- Section 1 -->
		<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
		
		<p>
			HTML, which stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is a
			coding language that makes up the base of every webpage on the internet.
			By using HTML, you can also make your own website. Here is an example of
			an extremely simple website:
		</p>
		
		<br>

		<!-- Code block for an example of an extremely simple HTML website -->
		<code>
			&nbsp;	&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;						<br>
			&nbsp;	&lt;html&gt;							<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;head&gt;						<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;		<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;/head&gt;						<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;body&gt;						<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;		<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;		<br>
			&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&lt;/body&gt;						<br>
			&nbsp;	&lt;/html&gt;
		</code>		

		<br><br>

		<p>
			The above code may look a bit confusing to those who don't know HTML, but
			it's actually really simple when it's broken down. Firstly, HTML uses <strong>
			tags</strong> in order to control every aspect of the website, both those that
			are seen and those that are not. Tags are surrounded by <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
			brackets, and for most tags, but not all, there will be an <strong>end tag</strong>,
			which is signified by a <code>/</code> before the name inside the angle brackets.
			This means that the tag contains everything from the start tag to that end tag.
		</p>

		<!-- Section 2 -->
		<h2>What are some mandatory HTML tags for making a website?</h2>

		<p>
			All html pages start with the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tag, which is an
			<em>empty</em> tag. It's called empty because it has no end tag, and therefore does
			not contain any text or elements. This tag lets the website know that the file is
			written in HTML when it reads your code to make the website. The following 
			<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tags must surround the entire
			HTML code, and everything inside it will be read as HTML code instead of text.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags surround all the data that is not seen
			on the website itself. This includes language, tab title, and <a href="CSS.html">stylesheets</a>,
			which will be discussed further in-depth in the later pages of this website. In this case,
			the <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> tags inside the head element are setting the text
			inside, <code>Page Title</code>, as the tab title, which will appear as the text on the tab at the
			top of the search engine.
		</p>

		<!-- Image showing where the "tab title" is located -->
		<img width="50%" src="res/images/tabtitles.jpg" alt="An indication of where the tab title appears: on the tab selectors at the top of the search engine" />

		<p>
			The <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags, as their nams suggests, contain the body of the website,
			which is everything you can see. There are a multitude of HTML elements that can be added in the body section
			of the website, from <a href="T_F.html">headers, paragraphs, and other text</a> to <a href="L_I.html">links,
			images, and videos</a>, and so much more! In this case, the body section contains a <em>header</em>, (the
			<code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tags) which reads "This is a Heading", and a paragraph, (the
			<code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags) which reads "This is a paragraph."<br><br>
			And that's it! It's as simple as that! However, if you want to make your website a bit more complex than that
			simple example, the following table will list some other commonly used html elements you might want to add 
			to your repertoire:
		</p>

		<!-- Table of assorted HTML tags and their descriptions-->
		<table>
			<tr>
				<!-- Headers of the table columns -->
				<th>HTML Tag</th>
			  	<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining comments in HTML -->
			  	<td><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code></td>
			  	<td>
					  This is a unique tag, which represents a comment. It is an empty tag, but there can be anyting in between
					  the start of the bracket, <strong>&lt;!--</strong>, and the end of the bracket, <strong>--&gt;</strong>.
					  Any text in between the two is completely ignored when creating the website from the HTML file, and so this
					  tag's only use is to leave comments explaining the code or giving other information to anyone who would read the
					  HTML file.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <br> tag -->
			  	<td><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></td>
			  	<td>
					This is an empty tag. Its purpose is to move down a line vertically, similar to hitting the <em>ENTER</em> key on the 
					keyboard when typing.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <center></center> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</code></td>
				<td>Anything between these HTML tags will be centered horizontally on the webpage.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <form></form> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					With many arguments and many options for tags that should go inside it, the form tag is certainly complex. This tag creates a 
					fillable form. There are HTML tags for different types of questions that can be added to the form, and an argument to determine
					how the data is kept or used.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <input> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					A tag that is used inside the <strong>form</strong> tag in order to add responses to the form, for visitors to the website to fill out.
					It has arguments for the type of response method it should be.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <hr> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Creates a horizontal line across the webpage.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <img> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Display an image to the screen. Uses the attribute <strong>src</strong> to get the image.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <link> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Used to reference a separate code file. Not to be confused with a <em>hyperlink</em>, which has a tag of <strong>a</strong>. Used in the head section
					of an HTML code.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <meta> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Controls a variety of metadata about the website, such as character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Used in
					the head section of an HTML code.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <ol></ol> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Contains an ordered (numbered) list. The list elements go inside this tag.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <ul></ul> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					Contains an unordered (bulleted) list. The list elements go inside this tag.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<!-- Explaining the <li></li> tag -->
				<td><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></td>
				<td>
					List elements. Each <strong>li</strong> element contains the text or any other content that is meant to be listed in the unordered or ordered list that this element
					is a child of.
				</td>
			</tr>

			With all of these elements, and many more, you will be able to make stunning websites!
