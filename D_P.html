		<h1>Dividers and Positioning</h1>

		<!-- Section 1 -->
		<h2>What are dividers?</h2>
		
		<p>
			In HTML, a divider is a section of a webpage. It is created using the <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
			tags. However, when used by itself, it does not affect the webpage in any way, shape or form. Despite this,
			the <em>div</em> element is far from useless; it truly shines when it is combined with CSS. There are many
			things you can do with dividers: it becomes easy to make block-layout webpages, to have blocks of information
			surrounded by other website content, to position groups of elements together, and even to create more complicated
			structures such as navigation bars, carousels, and so much more!
		</p>

		<p>
			Anything can go inside a div element, including another div. The main reasons why the div element is so valuable when
			it comes to performing complex tasks is because it can treat many elements as if they were one element, and because they
			can be easily positioned around the website while they contain those elements!
		</p>

		<!-- Section 2 -->
		<h2>How do you position elements?</h2>

		<p>
			Positioning elements is easiest done through CSS, where there are several options. One easy way to position items is to 
			use the <code>float</code> command, which can take values such as <code>center</code> or <code>left</code>. You can also
			use the <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> commands to move an element that has the property <code>display:
			block;</code> a certain distance away from the right or left edges of the webpage. The <code>text-align</code> command uses
			similar values as the <code>float</code> command, except it is applied to the child elements of the applied tag as well (despite
			being named text-align, it works on non-text elements as well!). This is a useful tool to use alongside the HTML <strong>div</strong> 
			element, to apply the position to the elements within it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, there is a tag in CSS called <code>position</code> which can be a very powerful tool. For example, for the navigation
			bar to follow the screen and always stick to the top of the page, the command <code>position: sticky</code> is used, in conjunction with
			<code>top: 0px;</code> in order to specify which edge the element should stick to, and how close it should be to start moving. Another notable
			option is <code>position: absolute;</code>, which allows you to place an element anywhere on the page, precisely, by specifying the distance it
			must be from the edges of the page, in space, not just the scrolling view of the page. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, some powerful tools in getting the delicate spacing of elements right are the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> commands. The margin
			command is used to determine how far away the element should push other elements from its border. You can set each side individually if you wish to do so.
			The padding command is mainly used with div elements, as it controls the space between the border of the div and the content inside it - basically the
			reverse of the margin command.
		</p>

		<p>
			With many tools for positioning, it can be overwhelming and difficult at times. However, this vast customizability can lead to very intricate and modern-looking websites!
