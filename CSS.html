		<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
		
		<p>
			CSS, which stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a
			coding language that is used alongside your HTML code in order to add, 
			as the name suggests, <strong>style</strong> to your website. CSS controls
			many visual aspects of your website, including colours, fonts, sizes,
			and many more specific adjustments that can be used to fine-tune your website
			into looking exactly how you envision it to be.

		<h2>How do you code in CSS?</h2>
		
		<p>
			To code in CSS, there are three steps. You must <u>define the HTML tag or tags
			that you want to apply the change to</u>, you must <u>choose which command you want
			to use</u>, and you must <u>specify its value</u>.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are three ways to add CSS to your HTML website. Firstly, you can add what is
			called <em>inline CSS</em> to any empty or starting tag. This is because each HTML
			tag has specific <strong>attributes</strong> that can be set for it, and every tag
			has the <code>style</code> attribute, which is where you can type CSS code. For example,
			the following HTML tag uses inline CSS:
		</p>

		<!-- Code segment for a header coloured red using inline CSS -->
		<code>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1 style="color: red;"&gt;This is a header&lt;/h1&gt;
		</code>

		<p>
			For the above example, the header tag has a style attribute, which sets its colour to
			<span style="color: red;">red</span>. The tag the CSS applies to is only the tag with the
			attribute, and no others. The command used is <code>color</code>, which sets the colour of
			the element. Finally, the value of the CSS command is <code>red</code>, which means that the
			color of the specified element, in this case the header, is red.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the other two methods, choosing a command and its value is the same:
		</p>

		<!-- Code segment for a template of a CSS command -->
		<code>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>command</em>: <em>value</em>;
		</code>

		<p>
			However, to select the tag or tags you want to edit, you must write the tag name, followed
			by curly brackets <code>{}</code>. Anything in the curly brackets will be applied to every tag
			of the type listed before the brackets. For example, this is an example of CSS code;
		</p>

		<!-- Code segment for all paragraphs being centered using CSS -->
		<code>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;p {							<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;}
		</code>

		<p>
			For the above example, every paragraph element will have its text alignment centered. This
			type of CSS command can be used inside the HTML <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> tags,
			in which case it is only applied to the HTML file it is in. Finally, you can make a <code>.css</code>
			file, where you write only in CSS, and then you can apply the CSS commands to any HTML file by using
			the command:
		</p>

		<!-- Code segment for an external stylesheet being linked into an HTML document -->
		<code>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
		</code>

		<p>
			where <strong>style.css</strong> can be replaced by the name of your CSS file.
